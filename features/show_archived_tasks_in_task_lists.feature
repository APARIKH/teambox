  In order to cut down on page load time
  As a Teambox developer
  I want users to see archived tasks in task lists quickly and easily

    And a confirmed user exists with login: "balint"
    And "balint" is in the project called "Market Teambox"
    And a task list exists with name: "This week"
    And the task list called "This week" belongs to the project called "Market Teambox"
    And a task exists with name: "Tell my friends"
    And a task exists with name: "Tell the tech bloggers"

  Scenario: See archived tasks
    Given the task called "Tell my friends" is archived
    And I am logged in as "balint"
    When I go to the list of tasks page of the project called "Market Teambox"
    Then I should see the task called "Tell the tech bloggers" in the "This week" task list panel
